Problem Statement - Industrializing Santa Inc.

Santa inc. is not just a world-famous enterprise, it is also amongst the most advanced tech companies.  
 
So far, their reliable AS400 backend as been able to deal with the load of letters and wishes formulated but a more flexible solution is now considered: a full microservice API backend. 
 
This new infrastructure will pair with a new front design. Currently, only the mockup has been designed by our geeky elf, your task will be to implement a single fully responsive page. Technology used is up to your choice. 
 
This web application will be used by our team of letter readers working comfortably on a desktop as well as the workshop team that needs more flexibility and works on tablets and finally by Santa himself during his delivery (yes, he is an Apple fanboy…)
 
Different use, different device, different display. As the desktop benefits from a larger area, the application will also have more bells and whistles. As the size decreases, only the most relevant information will be displayed. 
 
Mockups are joined, this page is the list of received letters and wishes from children, red lines in the list are the children that poorly behaved this year. For the phone view, the menu transforms into a burger menu and those red lines are hidden (no need to see them while delivering gifts). 
 
So far, the page you are going to develop is a prototype, endpoints are not ready yet, thus you will fake children data list but still, the whole page structure should be fully responsive and match, as much as possible, mockups. Code organization, technology used are your choice.
